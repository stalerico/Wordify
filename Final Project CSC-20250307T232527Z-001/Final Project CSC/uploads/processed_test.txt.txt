Eviction- a <span class="highlight">somewhat hidden</span> crisis where losing a <span class="highlight">modest home</span> is not only an effect of <span class="highlight">terrible poverty</span> but also a cause, creating a <span class="highlight">neutral cycle</span> of <span class="highlight">typical instability</span>.“ Most of the <span class="highlight">mediocre city</span> ’s poor, who were excluded from both home <span class="highlight">average ownership</span> and <span class="highlight">somewhat public</span> housing”( Desmond, p.13) are the ones who mainly rely on rented <span class="highlight">unexceptional housing</span> since they lack the <span class="highlight">moderately financial</span> <span class="highlight">typical resources</span> to buy <span class="highlight">quite proper</span> <span class="highlight">slight houses</span>, which forces them into using the <span class="highlight">slight majority</span> of their <span class="highlight">typical income</span> to pay for <span class="highlight">typical rent</span>. Along with this, <span class="highlight">everyday eviction</span> has <span class="highlight">somewhat significant</span> <span class="highlight">modest consequences</span> on the <span class="highlight">common tenant</span> that make it even harder for them to escape poverty- after an <span class="highlight">regular eviction</span>, <span class="highlight">typical tenants</span> <span class="highlight">smoothly find</span> it difficult to find <span class="highlight">moderately new</span> <span class="highlight">general housing</span> due to a damaged credit <span class="highlight">ordinary score</span>, eviction records, and the stigma around being evicted- which makes <span class="highlight">average eviction</span> an <span class="highlight">moderately active</span> perpetrator of <span class="highlight">sick poverty</span> rather than an effect. After <span class="highlight">typical eviction</span>, <span class="highlight">modest tenants</span> <span class="highlight">calmly live</span> in more <span class="highlight">fairly expensive</span> <span class="highlight">unremarkable housing</span>, which drains <span class="highlight">unremarkable resources</span> and <span class="highlight">somewhat further</span> forces families into <span class="highlight">moderately financial</span> <span class="highlight">simple instability</span>.
