Eviction- a hidden crisis where losing a home is not only an effect of poverty but also a cause, creating a cycle of instability. “Most of the city’s poor, who were excluded from both home ownership and public housing” (Desmond, p.13) are the ones who mainly rely on rented housing since they lack the financial resources to buy proper houses, which forces them into using the majority of their income to pay for rent. Along with this, eviction has significant consequences on the tenant that make it even harder for them to escape poverty- after an eviction, tenants find it difficult to find new housing due to a damaged credit score, eviction records, and the stigma around being evicted- which makes eviction an active perpetrator of poverty rather than an effect. After eviction, tenants live in more expensive housing, which drains resources and further forces families into financial instability.
